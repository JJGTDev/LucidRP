# EasyAdmin-MySQL

Add this after mysql-async and before EasyAdmin in your Resource Start Order, then make sure that
```
set ea_custombanlist "true"
```
is set in your server config file.

Done! EasyAdmin-MySQL will handle the rest automatically, do note that your banlist will have to be converted manually.
